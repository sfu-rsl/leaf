# Leaf
Concolic execution for Rust through MIR instrumentation.

Welcome to project Leaf, a tool to perform dynamic symbolic execution for Rust programs.
Leaf helps you with tracking the constraints put on particular variables of interest during the execution of the program.

Leaf aims to be robust, extensible, and easily-integrable within real world Rust testing stacks.

Please refer to [Introduction](./intro.md) for more details about the workflow of the tool,
and to [Getting Started](./user_guide/getting_started.md) to learn how to use it.
